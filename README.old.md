# react-native-thunder-talks
React-native app for 15-minute thunder-talk; adds two numbers together and presents the results modally

## Notes:
* What is react native?
    * Library that builds upon React & JavaScript to create native apps in either Android / iOS or both
    * With what we know already, we can build apps that are tailored specifically to iOS or Android -- but we don't have to write or use Swift or Java
    * Allows you to use React & JavaScript during the build-process; your code is compiled into respective native Swift / Java code
     * Different from something like Cordova, which is just a 'wrapper' for your web-app; you can even write with Swift / Java
